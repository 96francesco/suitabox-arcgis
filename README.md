## Description
Suitabox uses meteorological data collected from local station networks to analyze the suitable distribution of a tree crop in a specific area based on agroecological criteria. There are 4 default crops at this moment (avocado, kiwifruit, European hazelnut and walnut), and the criteria applied to these crops were obtained from scientific literature. Suitabox allows users to submit customized parameters, through a specific tool, in order to provide them more flexibility and because there aren't many references about specific agroecological thresholds. In addition, the toolkit allows users to use four [RCP models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_Concentration_Pathway) to explore how a climate change scenario can influence a crop species within the considered study area. Suitabox now only uses air temperature and elevation data, with no soil data or other meteorological variables, to maintain simplicity for all types of users, but fresh updates will soon fill in these gaps.

## **Installation**

# **Usage**
Double-click on a tool within the toolbox to open it and start using it. Please see the tool metadata/help documentation for more information on how to use each tool.

## Tools
At the moment, Suitabox only has two tools. Updates with new tools will be made available soon. **Crop Suitability tool** is the core instrument of this toolbox, while **Custom Crop Pre-Processing** serves as a support for the *Custom Crop* option in the former tool.

## Alerts
Unfortunately for ArcGIS Pro users, the automatic upload of the symbology does not work for the stretched values maps and the additional outputs due to a possible [bug](https://community.esri.com/t5/python-questions/arcpy-management-applysymbologyfromlayer-works/td-p/1137999) in the [ArcPy ApplySymbologyFromLayer() module](https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/data-management/apply-symbology-from-layer.htm). The users can manually upload the symbology provided within the folder using the Symbology panel and select **Import from layer file**.
